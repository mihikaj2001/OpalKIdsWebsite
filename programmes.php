         <h4>SCHOOL</h4>
         <p>We cater to children from 10 months to 5 years. The School focuses on all facets of Child Development including Linguistic, Physical, Socio-emotional, Cognitive and Creative areas. All areas of growth and development are given equal importance. Latest research in Early Childhood Education shows that the experiences in the early years (under age 5 years) shape a child's adulthood. We keep in mind that 50% of a child’s cognitive development happens by age 5. Hence, we advocate preschools over regular schools in those tender years, so that personal attention can be paid to each child.</p>

         <h4>PLAYGROUP</h4>
         <p>In this environment we support the following areas of development by having focused activities wrt:<br>
1.<b>Brain development</b> - Most of a child’s brain development happens during this period.<br>

2.<b>Movement development</b> - A child’s pincer grip develops during this period which is required for writing in future.<br>

3.<b>Language development</b> - children are interested in learning Nouns, which is also known as the <b><i>WHAT </i>period.</b> <br>

4.<b>Practical life skills</b> - Practical life activities like care of oneself and the environment fulfill the urge to be independent and support development of concentration, work attitude and will power.<br>

5.<b>Food Activities</b> – We help the child understand the importance of food and help them develop healthy eating habits.<br>

6.<b>Art Activities</b> - Activities like scribbling, coloring, etc. support creative development in them.<br>

7.<b>Toilet Training</b> – Our trained staff works with the kids and helps them become toilet trained faster.</p>

        <h4>NURSERY, PP1 & PP2</h4>
      Children between the age group of 2 1/2 to 5 1/2 years of age are highly interested in developing spoken language and doing every activity. This is the time when their social self begins to develop and they experience the need of a peer group.
      In the self-interpretive environment, we cater to the following 5 areas of development:<br>
      1. <b>Sensorial</b>- Offer materials which help develop senses.<br>
      2. <b>Language</b> - Offered at the Spoken, Written and Reading levels.<br>
      3. <b>Mathematical</b> - Ranges from the Concept of Numeration, rote counting, value association, addition and subtraction. <br>
      4. <b>Cultural</b> - Various items of human culture like concepts (shapes, colours, etc.) Environmental studies (plants, animals, water bodies, transports etc.) Music and Art. <br>
      5. <b>Exercises of Practical Life</b>- We give children a precise method to work on activities people around them do. This develops co-ordination, concentration independence.<br>

The center is spread over 2700 sft, providing ample space for the children to play.<br> <br> We have a playing area for the children, toys, books, puzzles, building blocks, toy-cars and much more. Every afternoon after lunch we have a nap time for the children. We ensure every child gets rest with respect to his/her sleep schedule. We have evening snack time and the staff plays with the children afterwards. Daycare facility is extended till 7:00pm everyday including Saturdays. <br> <br>The Daycare facility at Opalkids is a sigh of relief for working parents as it is a second home for the child where the parents can leave their baby without a moment's hesitation due to the love and care provided by our gentle all-female staff. </p>

      <h5>TUITIONS AND COACHING</h5>
      <br>
      <p>We provide coaching in all subjects by trained teachers from class 1 – Class 10. We ensure that the child understands the subject and doesn't just mug up coarse material. This ensures all round improvement in the child’s performance and radically improved grades. We provide our own tutorial sheets for practice and testing.</p>

      <h5>ACTIVITIES AND SUMMER CAMP</h5>
      <br>
        <p>OpalKids also offers activity classes in the evening. These are conducted and managed by professionals. Activities include dance, Art and Craft, painting etc. We also have an annual summercamp for kids of different age groups starting from 3yrs upto 12yrs. Here, we have many learning activities like dance, art and craft, fireless cooking, karate etc. <br><br>We believe that the best way to keep education going during the summer is to ensure that it is done in a funfilled way so that it feels like a holiday yet ensures a continuation of learning.<br><br> And what better way for parents to get a little time off of parenting in the summer than to send the kids off to camp every morning where they can meet new children and have some fun.</p>
